# HACE_project
HACE project of detecting fish farms by satellite images


The folders called train,test,valid are folders used to store training and testing images, so just simply enter the folders and place images under "images/" and labels under "labels/"


# Open the Jupyter notebook on Colab, this notebook is best to run on colab, remember to set the runtime to enable GPU usage, which will accelerate the inference speed
When you open the notebook on Colab, you can just follow the steps and documentations in the notebook to train, evaluate and test your model.<br><br>

When a model is trained, continue to follow the steps in notebook and enter the path of the trained model <br><br>
And you can see there are codes to use satellite images from Google Maps Static API, where you have the highest quality of satellite images, you just need to define the longitude and latitude<br><br>
you just need to set up your Google Maps Static API on this webpage https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/maps-static/cloud-setup <br><br>
And you can also directly use an image from your storage<br><br>
